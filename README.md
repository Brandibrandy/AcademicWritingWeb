# AcademicWritingWeb

‎I need to design a smart, unique and fantastic dynamic web application simply meant for sharing and providing academic writing tips and also materials like notes among other materials and tips.
‎These website should have about 5 pages.
‎1. Homepage
‎2. Writingstyles 
‎3. WritingTools
‎4. WritingTests
‎5. AccountPage
‎6. FAQs
‎
‎A user should be able to sign in the web application by using an email and a password. Once signed in, every user should be able to access all the features and materials as necessary. 
‎The landing page at home should be nice and contain texts, images and other features related to Academic writing. The home page should be nice and dynamically interactive having great resources to amaze the user and explain everything in details. 
‎
‎The header containing the navigations for the pages, should remain fixed at the left side of  all the pages even during scrolling.
‎All the pages should contain a fixed footer containing privacy policy or terms. 
‎
‎The writing styles page should contain notes on all the main and most used academic styles and show guides of each style notes dynamically. Like apa, MLA, havards, among others. Good and nice content. 
‎The writing tools page should show and teach the user of all available academic writing tools used to do assignments and how to approach tasks. These tools are like Ai and plagiarism checking tools, grammar checking tools, paraphrasing tools and proofreading tools. Nice features and styles making the page dynamic. 
‎
‎The writing tests page should show and alert the user of any writing good standards and what to observe. Then this page should contain tests for the user with choices. The user will use the test to check their writing understanding. 
‎
‎FAQs page should show in style and dynamically using great features all FAQs and their answers or solutions.
